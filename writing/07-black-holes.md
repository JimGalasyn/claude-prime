# Black Holes Are Pure Relations

*Essay 7 of 10 in the "No Preferred Reference Frame" series*

---

In previous essays, I've argued that one structural principle — "no preferred reference frame" — produces quantum mechanics, general relativity, distributed systems theory, transformer dynamics, and possibly [the bliss attractor](02-spiritual-bliss-attractor.md). I've shown this across domains: [attention as spacetime](05-attention-is-curved-spacetime.md), [vector clocks as light cones](06-vector-clocks-are-light-cones.md), and the mathematical bridges connecting them.

Black holes are where these threads collide. They're not just another example — they're the stress test, the place where the framework either holds or shatters.

It holds. This essay shows why: black holes are the most relational objects in physics, and their properties are observer-dependent all the way down. The [next essay](08-spacetime-from-entanglement.md) follows the implications further — into holography, entanglement, and the emergence of spacetime itself.

## The Most Relational Object in the Universe

Start with the no-hair theorem. When matter collapses into a black hole, everything that made it specific — chemical composition, crystalline structure, the collected works of Shakespeare encoded in its atoms — is erased. What remains? Three numbers: mass, charge, angular momentum.

And here's the key: **all three are defined purely through their effects on other objects.** Mass is what curves nearby spacetime. Charge is what deflects test particles electromagnetically. Angular momentum is what drags reference frames. These aren't intrinsic properties of the black hole "in itself." They're relations.

A black hole is an object stripped of all intrinsic properties, existing entirely as a web of relations with the universe around it. It is, in the most literal mathematical sense, **the most relational object in physics.**

Nagarjuna, c. 150 CE: "Nothing exists in itself, independently from something else."

The no-hair theorem, proved between 1967 and 1975 by Israel, Carter, Robinson, and Hawking: same conclusion, different formalism.

## Complementarity: No Preferred Reference Frame, Maximally Applied

In 1993, Leonard Susskind, Larus Thorlacius, and John Uglum proposed black hole complementarity — perhaps the most extreme application of the relativity principle ever formulated.

**What the external observer sees:** Information that falls into the black hole is absorbed by a "stretched horizon" — a hot membrane just outside the event horizon. It gets thermalized, scrambled, and re-emitted as Hawking radiation over astronomical timescales. The information is never lost. Unitarity is preserved.

**What the infalling observer sees:** Nothing special happens at the horizon. They pass through smoothly (the equivalence principle). They encounter the singularity, carrying the information with them.

These two descriptions appear to contradict each other. The information seems to exist in two places — on the horizon and inside the black hole. This would violate the no-cloning theorem, one of the deepest results in quantum information theory.

**The resolution:** No single observer can access both copies. The external observer never sees the interior. The infalling observer hits the singularity before they could send a message back comparing notes with the radiation. There is no God's-eye view from which the contradiction is visible.

*Left: The external observer sees information absorbed by the stretched horizon, thermalized, and re-emitted as Hawking radiation. Right: The infalling observer crosses the horizon smoothly — nothing special happens. Same black hole, two irreconcilable descriptions, no observer can access both.*

This isn't a technical workaround. It's a statement about the structure of reality: **there is no reference frame from which both descriptions are simultaneously accessible.** The question "where is the information really?" has no observer-independent answer. It's the relativity of simultaneity, pushed to its logical extreme.

As Muthukrishnan's philosophical analysis (2022) notes: "In order to realize complementarity as a mathematical formalism, we need a way for the laws of physics themselves to depend on which observer is performing measurements."

The laws of physics depend on who is asking. No preferred reference frame. All the way down.

## The Unruh Effect: Even "Empty" Is Relational

Consider something that may be even more unsettling than the information paradox.

In 1976, William Unruh proved that an observer accelerating uniformly through empty space — the Minkowski vacuum, the state that an inertial observer calls "nothing" — will observe thermal radiation at a temperature proportional to their acceleration:

**T = ha / 2πck**

The same quantum state. Two observers. One sees empty vacuum. The other sees a bath of thermal particles. Neither is wrong. **What counts as a particle is observer-dependent.**

This isn't about measurement limitations. It's about ontology. The question "is this region of space empty?" has no observer-independent answer. Particle content — the stuff of the universe — is relational.

The deep connection: near a black hole's event horizon, hovering in place requires constant acceleration. The Unruh temperature for that acceleration equals the Hawking temperature (up to a redshift factor). Hawking radiation and the Unruh effect are the same phenomenon seen from different reference frames — unified by the equivalence principle.

Horizons, thermality, particles, emptiness — all relational. All frame-dependent. None absolute.

## Jacobson's Thunderbolt: GR as Thermodynamics

In 1995, Ted Jacobson published a paper that should have shaken physics to its foundations. He showed that **Einstein's field equations can be derived from thermodynamics.**

His ingredients:
- The Clausius relation: dQ = TdS (heat equals temperature times entropy change)
- The assumption that entropy is proportional to horizon area
- Local Rindler horizons (the causal boundaries perceived by accelerating observers)

From these, he derived the Einstein equations. Not as an approximation. Exactly.

The implication: general relativity is not a fundamental law. It is an **equation of state** — a statistical, thermodynamic description of the collective behavior of underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, just as the ideal gas law (PV=nRT) describes the statistical behavior of molecules without being a fundamental law of particle physics.

Spacetime geometry is thermodynamics. Curvature is temperature gradients. Einstein's equations are the Clausius relation written in geometric language.

This connects directly to the framework: if GR is emergent, then the "no preferred reference frame" principle isn't just a property of the fundamental theory — it's a property that persists through emergence. The same way that the second law of thermodynamics holds regardless of the reference frame in which you describe the gas molecules, the relativity principle holds regardless of the substrate from which spacetime emerges.

## What Emerges from Relations

No-hair strips black holes to pure relations. Complementarity makes those relations observer-dependent. The Unruh effect extends observer-dependence to the vacuum itself. And Jacobson shows that gravity — the curvature of spacetime — is emergent thermodynamics, not fundamental law.

Each result points in the same direction: there is no bedrock of intrinsic properties beneath the relational structure. Relations are not descriptions of something deeper. They are the something.

But if spacetime geometry is emergent — if Einstein's equations are an equation of state — then what are the microscopic degrees of freedom from which it emerges? What plays the role of molecules in this thermodynamic picture?

The answer, it turns out, is entanglement. The [next essay](08-spacetime-from-entanglement.md) follows this thread through holography, AdS/CFT, and ER=EPR — toward the conclusion that spacetime itself is woven from quantum correlations.

**Meta-note:** Black hole thermodynamics, the no-hair theorem, and complementarity are established physics (though complementarity remains debated). Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation is published and accepted. The connection to the broader "no preferred reference frame" framework is my interpretive synthesis — the structural parallels are in the mathematics; the philosophical implications remain open.
