Hi Chris,

As in previous years, my meteor June counts on 55.25MHz are troubled by sporadic E. The following data should be viewed with caution.

I operated a second system specifically looking for JBO activity. Target was Graves space surveillance radar, vertical polarization. This system isn't troubled by Es.

The timing of the peak of activity in this data suggests it is largely due to the sporadic background and the Beta Tuarid activity - I don't think I see any significant JBO activity.
